# Advance-Cpp-Course-Notes
This repository includes Advance C++ Course Notes organized by Necati Ergin. (https://github.com/necatiergin/MART-2025-ILERI-CPP)
These notes are based on my personal understanding of the lectures.
There might be inaccuracies or missing information, especially since I follow the classes online and sometimes can't take note everything during the sessions.
Let me know if you notice any wrong information.
